🎨 Customization Guide
If you want to use this template for yourself, here are a few tips:

1. Change Colors: Open style.css and look for the :root section at the very top. Change these hex codes to your favorite colors:

CSS
:root {
    --bg-color: #0f172a;        /* Main Background */
    --accent: #38bdf8;          /* Highlight Color */
    /* ... */
}
2. Update Content: Open index.html. You can easily swap out my text for yours. For example, find the <h1> tag to change the name:

HTML
<h1>Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Your Name</span></h1>
3. Replace Images: Add your own photo to the assets folder and update the src attribute in the HTML:

HTML
<img src="assets/your-photo.jpg" alt="Profile Pic">
